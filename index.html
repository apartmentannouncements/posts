	<p>Hello everyone, this is just a friendly PSA.</p>
	<p>I'd just like to remind everyone not to defecate in the driveway, if at all possible.  I understand it's midterm season and we're all getting busy, a little stressed, you know how it goes.  But please try to keep your f&aeligces inside your body while in the driveway.  I unfortunately spent a good 50 minutes cleaning f&aeligces off of the bottom of my shoes, and I likely got some on my keyboard as I'm typing this now.  While I can't deny that the cleaning did have its fun moments, it wasn't something I'd like to do again, at least for not another week or so.</p>

	<p>I don't want to point fingers or name names here, but I will say that the consistency of the f&aeligces I removed from my shoe tonight certainly had a confirmed match in my records.  And while this incident was the fault of just one person, it's certain that to varying degrees we're all to blame.  I'm sure we've all defecated in the driveway at some point in the past two and a half semesters; I know I have many times.  But we need to take some action to make sure that this kind of thing doesn't happen again in the future.  Or in the very least, that it doesn't happen too often.</p>

	<p>So, in order to decrease the chances of one of us making a whoopsie, whenever one of us feels the urge to defecate while in the driveway, let's all do our part to tightly clench our bowels.  I firmly believe that if we work together on this, we can make our apartment a better place for all residents now and in the many years to come.  And remember, like the expression says, <span style="color: #FF5252">teamwork makes the dream reach its full potential</span>.</p>
